== Post-installation (optional)

=== Use pm2 to run Lisk Core in the background

It is recommended to use a process manager like {url_pm2}[PM2^] to run Lisk Core in the background.

Check the guide xref:{url_mgmt_pm2}[] for more information.

=== Log rotation

It is recommended to set up a log rotation, because the log of Lisk Core files can grow very big over time.

Check the guide xref:{url_config_logrotation}[Managing logs] in the SDK docs for more information.
